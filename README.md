# clj-gitignore
The ultimate gitignore file for clojure(script) projects


# The Problem
The current gitignore templates always have things missing, and extensions like `.clj-kondo` and `.lsp/*` have to be added.
Let's have one less thing to worry about. :)

# Aim
I want this to become the go to gitignore file for clojure projects.
So this is very much a community project and I want people to contribute and suggest ways to improve this.

And one fine day, if this becomes popular, I'd like to merge it with the standard lein template :)

# To Do

Find a sane way to organize all these extensions.
